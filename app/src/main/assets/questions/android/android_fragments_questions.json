    {"id": "fragment_theory_1", "questionText": "What is a Fragment in Android?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A Fragment is a reusable portion of your app's UI that has its own lifecycle and can be added to an Activity or other Fragments.", "explanation": "Fragments allow modular UI development. A Fragment must be hosted in an Activity.", "codeExample": "class MyFragment : Fragment() {\n    override fun onCreateView(\n        inflater: LayoutInflater,\n        container: ViewGroup?,\n        savedInstanceState: Bundle?\n    ): View? {\n        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_my, container, false)\n    }\n}", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    {"id": "fragment_theory_2", "questionText": "What is the difference between Activity and Fragment?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "An Activity is a standalone screen with its own window. A Fragment is a modular UI component that must be hosted within an Activity.", "explanation": "Activities can exist independently and have their own window. Fragments are dependent on Activities and cannot exist without a host.", "codeExample": "// Activity - standalone\nclass MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Fragment - must be hosted\nclass MyFragment : Fragment() {\n    // ...\n}", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    {"id": "fragment_theory_3", "questionText": "What is FragmentManager and what is its purpose?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "FragmentManager is responsible for managing Fragments within an Activity, including adding, removing, replacing, and handling Fragment transactions.", "explanation": "FragmentManager handles Fragment back stack, transactions, and Fragment-Activity communications.", "codeExample": "val fragmentManager = supportFragmentManager\n// Add fragment\nfragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n    .add(R.id.container, MyFragment())\n    .commit()", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    {"id": "fragment_theory_4", "questionText": "What is the difference between add() and replace() in Fragment transactions?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "add() adds a Fragment to the container without removing existing ones. replace() removes all existing Fragments in the container before adding the new one.", "explanation": "Use add() to stack Fragments, replace() to swap them. add() is useful for overlays/dialogs.", "codeExample": "// Add\nsupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n    .add(R.id.container, fragment)\n    .commit()\n// Replace\nsupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n    .replace(R.id.container, fragment)\n    .commit()", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    {"id": "fragment_theory_5", "questionText": "What is the Fragment back stack?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "The Fragment back stack is a history of Fragment transactions that allows users to navigate back through Fragment changes using the Back button.", "explanation": "Transactions added with addToBackStack() can be popped with the back button.", "codeExample": "supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n    .replace(R.id.container, fragment)\n    .addToBackStack(null)\n    .commit()", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    {"id": "fragment_theory_6", "questionText": "How do you pass data between Fragments?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "You can pass data between Fragments using Bundle arguments, ViewModel, or interface callbacks depending on the use case.", "explanation": "Bundle for simple data; ViewModel or callback for complex/inter-Fragment communication.", "codeExample": "// Using Bundle\nval fragment = MyFragment()\nval args = Bundle()\nargs.putString(\"key\", \"value\")\nfragment.arguments = args\n// Using ViewModel\nval viewModel = ViewModelProvider(requireActivity())[SharedViewModel::class.java]", "imageUrl": "", "difficulty": "HARD"}
