      "questionText": "Explain the difference between a directed and an undirected graph. Give an example where a directed graph is essential.",
      "type": "THEORY",
      "correctAnswer": "In a directed graph, edges have a direction (from one vertex to another), while in an undirected graph, edges do not have a specific direction. A directed graph is essential in representing dependencies, such as a prerequisite system or web page links.",
      "explanation": "Directed graphs model situations where relationships are asymmetric (e.g., following on social media, or task dependencies). Undirected graphs are symmetric, as in physical connections between computers in a network.",
      "codeExample": "val graph = mutableMapOf<Int, MutableList<Int>>() // adjacency list for directed graph\ngraph[1] = mutableListOf(2)\ngraph[2] = mutableListOf(3)",
