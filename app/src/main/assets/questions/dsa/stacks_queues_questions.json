      "questionText": "Describe the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide one common use-case for each.",
      "type": "THEORY",
      "correctAnswer": "A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle where the last element added is removed first. A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle where the first element added is removed first. Stacks are commonly used for function call management and undo operations; queues are used for scheduling tasks and order processing.",
      "explanation": "Stacks operate with two main operations: push and pop, and are crucial for recursive function stacks, browser history, etc. Queues operate with enqueue and dequeue, essential in resource scheduling and breadth-first search.",
      "codeExample": "// Stack (Kotlin)\nval stack = Stack<Int>()\nstack.push(1)\nstack.pop()\n// Queue (Kotlin)\nval queue: Queue<Int> = LinkedList()\nqueue.add(1)\nqueue.poll()",
