      "correctAnswer": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. A classic example is calculating factorial or solving the Tower of Hanoi.",
      "explanation": "Recursive solutions simplify code for problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems, e.g., traversing tree structures or permutations generation.",
      "codeExample": "fun factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n-1)",
