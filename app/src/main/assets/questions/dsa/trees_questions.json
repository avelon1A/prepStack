      "questionText": "What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST)?",
      "type": "THEORY",
      "correctAnswer": "A binary tree is a tree structure where each node has at most two children. A binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of binary tree in which the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.",
      "explanation": "BSTs enable efficient search, insertion, and deletion due to their sorted structure. Regular binary trees do not enforce order, so their traversal operations are less optimized for searching.",
      "codeExample": "class TreeNode(val value: Int, val left: TreeNode?, val right: TreeNode?)\n// Binary Search property:\n// left.value < node.value < right.value",
