      "type": "THEORY",
      "correctAnswer": "Merge Sort is a stable, O(n log n) sorting algorithm best suited for linked lists and external sorting. Quick Sort is O(n log n) on average but O(n^2) worst case. It is generally faster for arrays and in-memory sorting due to locality of reference.",
      "explanation": "Merge Sort divides and merges, and is more predictable in performance. Quick Sort partitions based on a pivot, and its speed comes from efficient memory use, but risks degradation on poor input order.",
      "codeExample": "// Merge Sort\nfun mergeSort(arr: IntArray) { /* ... */ }\n// Quick Sort\nfun quickSort(arr: IntArray) { /* ... */ }",
