      "questionText": "What is dynamic programming, and how does it differ from recursion and greedy algorithms?",
      "type": "THEORY",
      "correctAnswer": "Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization technique that solves problems by combining solutions to subproblems, storing these solutions to avoid recomputation. DP differs from recursion by using memoization/tabulation to avoid repetition; greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices without considering subproblems.",
      "explanation": "DP applies to problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, such as the Fibonacci sequence or knapsack problem. DP stores previously computed results to streamline calculation, recursion does not.",
      "codeExample": "fun fibonacci(n: Int, memo: IntArray): Int {\n    if (n <= 1) return n\n    if (memo[n] != 0) return memo[n]\n    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n}",
