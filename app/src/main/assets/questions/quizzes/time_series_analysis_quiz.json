    {"id": "time_series_quiz_1", "questionText": "What is the primary purpose of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test in time series analysis?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["To test for stationarity", "To measure seasonality strength", "To select the optimal model order", "To test for autocorrelation"], "correctAnswer": "To test for stationarity", "explanation": "The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used to determine if a time series is stationary by testing the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in the time series (indicating non-stationarity). Rejecting the null hypothesis suggests stationarity.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "time_series_quiz_2", "questionText": "What technique is commonly used to make a non-stationary time series stationary?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Differencing", "Squaring", "Normalization", "Principal Component Analysis"], "correctAnswer": "Differencing", "explanation": "Differencing (subtracting consecutive observations) is a common method to remove trends and make a non-stationary time series stationary. First-order differencing removes linear trends, while second-order differencing can remove quadratic trends.", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "time_series_quiz_3", "questionText": "In an ARIMA(2,1,0) model, what do the numbers represent?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["p=2 (AR terms), d=1 (differencing), q=0 (MA terms)", "p=0 (AR terms), d=1 (differencing), q=2 (MA terms)", "Lag 2, 1st degree trend, no error", "2 parameters, 1 variable, 0 constraints"], "correctAnswer": "p=2 (AR terms), d=1 (differencing), q=0 (MA terms)", "explanation": "In ARIMA(p,d,q) notation, p represents the number of autoregressive terms, d represents the degree of differencing required for stationarity, and q represents the number of moving average terms. So ARIMA(2,1,0) has 2 AR terms, uses 1st order differencing, and has 0 MA terms.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "time_series_quiz_4", "questionText": "What does seasonality in a time series represent?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals", "Random fluctuations in the data", "The overall increasing or decreasing trend", "Long-term cycles without fixed frequency"], "correctAnswer": "Regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals", "explanation": "Seasonality refers to patterns in the data that repeat at regular, known intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly patterns. These are predictable fluctuations that occur consistently over time.", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "time_series_quiz_5", "questionText": "Which plot is most useful for identifying the order of an AR or MA process in time series modeling?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["ACF and PACF plots", "Histogram", "Q-Q plot", "Scatter plot"], "correctAnswer": "ACF and PACF plots", "explanation": "Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots show correlations between a series and its lags. The patterns in these plots help identify appropriate orders for autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms in ARIMA models.", "difficulty": "HARD"}
