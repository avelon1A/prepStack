    {"id": "stat_test_quiz_1", "questionText": "What does a p-value of 0.03 indicate in hypothesis testing?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["There is a 3% probability that the null hypothesis is true", "There is a 3% probability that the alternative hypothesis is true", "There is a 3% probability of observing the data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true", "There is a 3% probability that the test results are incorrect"], "correctAnswer": "There is a 3% probability of observing the data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true", "explanation": "The p-value represents the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It does not directly tell us the probability of either hypothesis being true.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "stat_test_quiz_2", "questionText": "In hypothesis testing, what is a Type I error?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true", "Failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false", "Choosing the wrong statistical test", "Using an inadequate sample size"], "correctAnswer": "Rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true", "explanation": "A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, essentially finding an effect that doesn't exist (a false positive). The probability of a Type I error is controlled by the significance level (α).", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "stat_test_quiz_3", "questionText": "Which statistical test would be most appropriate for determining if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Independent samples t-test", "Paired samples t-test", "Chi-square test", "One-way ANOVA"], "correctAnswer": "Independent samples t-test", "explanation": "The independent samples t-test (or Student's t-test) is specifically designed to compare the means of two unrelated groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other, assuming the data is normally distributed.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "stat_test_quiz_4", "questionText": "What assumption is NOT required for parametric tests?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Equal sample sizes across groups", "Normal distribution of data", "Homogeneity of variance", "Independence of observations"], "correctAnswer": "Equal sample sizes across groups", "explanation": "While equal sample sizes can be beneficial for statistical power, they are not a strict requirement for most parametric tests. The other options are common assumptions for parametric tests: normal distribution, equal variances (homoscedasticity), and independent observations.", "difficulty": "HARD"},
    
    {"id": "stat_test_quiz_5", "questionText": "What happens to statistical power as sample size increases?", "type": "MCQ", "options": ["Power increases", "Power decreases", "Power remains the same", "Power may increase or decrease depending on the test"], "correctAnswer": "Power increases", "explanation": "Statistical power generally increases with larger sample sizes because larger samples provide more information and reduce sampling error, making it easier to detect true effects and correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false.", "difficulty": "EASY"}
