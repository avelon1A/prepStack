    {"id": "sql_joins_theory_1", "questionText": "What is a SQL JOIN?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.", "explanation": "Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, which is essential for working with relational databases.", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "sql_joins_theory_2", "questionText": "Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either table.", "explanation": "The type of join you choose determines which records are included in the result set, especially when dealing with records that don't have matches in the other table.", "codeExample": "-- INNER JOIN\nSELECT employees.name, departments.name \nFROM employees\nINNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;\n\n-- LEFT JOIN\nSELECT employees.name, departments.name \nFROM employees\nLEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "sql_joins_theory_3", "questionText": "What is a CROSS JOIN and when would you use it?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning each row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. You would use it when you need every possible combination of rows from two tables.", "explanation": "Cross joins are less common than other join types but are useful in specific scenarios like generating combinations or creating test data. Be cautious as they can produce very large result sets.", "codeExample": "SELECT products.name, colors.name\nFROM products\nCROSS JOIN colors;", "difficulty": "HARD"},
    
    {"id": "sql_joins_theory_4", "questionText": "What is a self-join and when would you use it?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A self-join is when a table is joined with itself. It's useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.", "explanation": "Self-joins are commonly used for organizational charts (manager-employee relationships), finding pairs of related items, or comparing rows within the same table.", "codeExample": "-- Find all employees and their managers\nSELECT e.name as employee, m.name as manager\nFROM employees e\nLEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;", "difficulty": "HARD"},
    
    {"id": "sql_joins_theory_5", "questionText": "What are non-equi joins?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Non-equi joins are joins that use comparison operators other than equals (=), such as >, <, >=, <=, or BETWEEN.", "explanation": "While most joins match records based on equality, non-equi joins use other comparison operators. They're useful for range comparisons or finding records within specific thresholds.", "codeExample": "-- Find employees whose salary is within a specific pay grade range\nSELECT e.name, p.grade \nFROM employees e\nJOIN pay_grades p ON e.salary BETWEEN p.min_salary AND p.max_salary;", "difficulty": "HARD"}
