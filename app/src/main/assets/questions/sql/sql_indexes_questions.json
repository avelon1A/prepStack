    {"id": "sql_index_theory_1", "questionText": "What is a database index?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It creates a pointer to the data based on the indexed column(s) to allow for faster searches.", "explanation": "Indexes work similar to a book index, allowing the database to find data without scanning the entire table. While they speed up SELECT queries, they can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations because the index must be updated.", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "sql_index_theory_2", "questionText": "What are the different types of indexes in SQL databases?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Common index types include single-column indexes, composite indexes (multiple columns), unique indexes, clustered indexes, non-clustered indexes, bitmap indexes, and full-text indexes.", "explanation": "Different index types serve different purposes. The choice depends on query patterns, data distribution, and the specific database management system being used.", "codeExample": "-- Create a single-column index\nCREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees(last_name);\n\n-- Create a composite index\nCREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(last_name, first_name);\n\n-- Create a unique index\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON employees(email);", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "sql_index_theory_3", "questionText": "What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. A table can have only one clustered index. Non-clustered indexes create a separate structure that points to the data. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.", "explanation": "Clustered indexes are like the way a dictionary is physically organized by the alphabetical order of words. Non-clustered indexes are more like a book index with page numbers pointing to content.", "difficulty": "HARD"},
    
    {"id": "sql_index_theory_4", "questionText": "When should you consider creating an index?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Consider creating an index on columns that: 1) Are frequently used in WHERE clauses, 2) Are used in JOIN conditions, 3) Have high selectivity (many unique values), 4) Are used in ORDER BY or GROUP BY clauses, 5) Are used with aggregate functions.", "explanation": "Indexing every column isn't recommended due to overhead on write operations. Focus on columns that will provide significant performance benefits for your query patterns.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "sql_index_theory_5", "questionText": "What is an execution plan and how does it relate to indexes?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "An execution plan shows how the database will execute a query, including which indexes it will use. Database optimizers generate execution plans and decide whether to use indexes based on statistics and cost estimates.", "explanation": "Analyzing execution plans helps you understand if your indexes are being used efficiently. Most database systems provide commands (like EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN PLAN) to view execution plans.", "codeExample": "-- MySQL/PostgreSQL\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith';\n\n-- SQL Server\nSET SHOWPLAN_TEXT ON;\nGO\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith';\nGO\nSET SHOWPLAN_TEXT OFF;\n", "difficulty": "HARD"}
