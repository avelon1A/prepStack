    {"id": "data_viz_theory_1", "questionText": "What are the key principles of effective data visualization?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "The key principles include: clarity (avoid clutter), accuracy (represent data truthfully), efficiency (maximize data-to-ink ratio), and purpose (design for the intended audience and message).", "explanation": "Good visualizations communicate insights clearly and honestly while avoiding unnecessary decorative elements that might distract from the data.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "data_viz_theory_2", "questionText": "When should you use a scatter plot versus a line chart?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Use scatter plots to show relationships between two numerical variables or to identify patterns, correlations, or outliers. Use line charts to display trends over time or to emphasize the continuity between data points.", "explanation": "Scatter plots excel at showing individual data points and their distribution, while line charts emphasize the connection and progression between sequential data points.", "difficulty": "EASY"},
    
    {"id": "data_viz_theory_3", "questionText": "What is the purpose of color in data visualization?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Color in data visualization serves several purposes: 1) To distinguish between categories, 2) To represent values (through color intensity), 3) To highlight important information, 4) To create visual hierarchy, and 5) To convey meaning through cultural associations.", "explanation": "Effective use of color enhances understanding, while poor color choices can mislead or create accessibility issues. Consider using colorblind-friendly palettes and ensuring sufficient contrast.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "data_viz_theory_4", "questionText": "What are heatmaps and when should they be used?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Heatmaps use color intensity to represent values in a matrix. They're effective for visualizing patterns in large datasets, showing correlations between variables, displaying complex tables of data, and identifying outliers or anomalies in multidimensional data.", "explanation": "Heatmaps work well when you have two categorical dimensions and want to show how a third variable (represented by color) varies across their combinations.", "difficulty": "MEDIUM"},
    
    {"id": "data_viz_theory_5", "questionText": "What is the difference between exploratory and explanatory data visualization?", "type": "THEORY", "correctAnswer": "Exploratory visualization is used during analysis to understand the data and discover insights. These visualizations may be complex and iterative. Explanatory visualization is used to communicate specific findings to others, with a clear narrative and polished presentation focused on key insights.", "explanation": "The audience and purpose differ: exploratory is for the analyst's benefit to find patterns, while explanatory is designed for sharing discoveries with others in a clear, compelling way.", "difficulty": "HARD"}
